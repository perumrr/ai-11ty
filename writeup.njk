<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">AI Assistance in This Assignment</h2>
<p>The AI tool I used (GPT 3.5) was helpful throughout this assignment, assisting me with debugging and providing suggestions for resolving errors. For example, when I encountered the issue of receiving [object Object] instead of the expected API data, the ChatGPT recommended using Alpine.js’s x-for directive to properly iterate over the data. This helped me display the content correctly.</p>

<p>However, the process was a trial and error experience. At times, the AI’s responses didn’t provide the most accurate solutions, requiring me to tweak the code. For instance, I had to adjust how asynchronous data fetching was handled to make sure the content was rendered properly. Despite these moments, ChatGPT’s ability to quickly suggest fixes and provide examples was very helpful in resolving issues and improving my code.</p>
